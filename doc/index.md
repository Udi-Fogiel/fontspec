The FONTSPEC package
====================

The `fontspec` package provides an automatic and unified interface for loading
fonts in LaTeX. XeTeX and LuaTeX (the latter through the `luaotfload` package)
allows a direct interface to fonts which may be loaded by their name or filename,
so no manual font installation is required.

This package also provides access to the large number of font features
available with OpenType (and other) fonts, including upper and lower case numbers,
proportional and monospaced numbers, swash letters, ligature control, and many
many others.

See the documentation `fontspec.pdf` ([CTAN version](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/unicodetex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.pdf), or [Github prerelease version](http://latex3.github.io/fontspec/fontspec.pdf)) for full information.
